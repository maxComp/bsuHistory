<b>Smylie signs measure creating full College</b><br>
Idaho Statesman February 7, 1965

<br>
Boise Junior College Saturday formally was authorized by the stroke of 16 pens to offer 
upper division courses and become a four-year, degree-granting college. The bill authorizing the 
expansion to four years of the institution that first opened its doors to Boise area students 33 years ago, 
was signed by Gov. Robert E. Smylie before an audience of 93 persons who crowded into his office.
<br><br>While the governor wrote his signature in small takes to accomodate the number of pens 
he used, persons who played the major part in devising the plan to give Boise a four-year school 
and pushing it through the legislature, looked on with obvious pleasure and smiles.
