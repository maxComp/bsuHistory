<b>Art, Business students design new College Seal</b><br>

Idaho Statesman January 28, 1968<br><br>
</center>
Spring semester 1969, Boise College will become Boise State College. A new school seal, created by two BC sophomores, Lee Bowlden and Leon Olson, will appear after the change on all college stationery, book covers, sweatshirts, mugs and jewelry. The seal itself was designed by Bowlden and the slogan, "Splendor Sine Orrasu"; was written by Olson.
<br><br>
Bowlden, who received $100 for his entry, included the traditional symbols of the college on the seal: the trees, the Boise River and the restored Episcopal Church. Olson was awarded $25 for his idea for the slogan. <br><br>  The winning entry was selected during the fall semester by a special committee, chairmanned by Bob Christopher, student body vice president. Other committee members were Louis A. Peck, art; Dr. J. Alfred McCauslin, 
dean of students; Bob Sylvester, history and Marcia Smith, student.<br><br>
A commercial art major, at BC, Bowlden plans to finish his junior and senior years at BC and hopes to attend school in California. Olson is a general business major and plans to achieve his M.S. and teach on the college level.
