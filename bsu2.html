<b>Bill signing will convert BSC into BSU</b><br>
Idaho Statesman February 21, 1974

<br>
Today is the last full day for "Boise State College."
Starting about 12:30 p.m. Friday, that institution along the Boise River east 
of Capitol Boulevard will be known officially as Boise State University. 
<br><br>Gov. Cecil Andrus' office Wednesday announced plans for ceremonies at 12:15 p.m. 
Friday in the BSC Student Union Building Ballroom to sign the bill changing 
the name to BSU.
The bill has an emergency clause attached so the name change goes into effect 
immediately.
<br><br>
The new name is the fourth for the local school. Founded in 1932 as a private community college, its name was Boise Junior College until 1965 when it became Boise College.
It was renamed Boise State College when it became part of the state system of higher education in 1969.
